Description:
I have created my first webpage as a My Profile page. It is designed to provide some basic information about me with pictures and I am proud of what I have accomplished so far. I know I will need to practice to hone my development skills and hope to do so from here on out. 


The class(es) I created are: 
.fixedHeaderName (background color, font-size, padding)
.fixedHeaderContact (background color, padding, text-decoration)
.landingBG (font-family, font-size, text-shadow)
.text (padding, text-align, text-shadow)
.numbertext (font-size, padding)
.dot (cursor, border-radius, display)
.fade (animation-name, animation-duration)
.aboutMe (display, flex-direction, text-align)


 
The javascript functions I created are: 
The javascript function I created is a slideshow containing various pictures of myself and my kids. You can scroll through the pictures using an arrow and each picture contains a caption.
